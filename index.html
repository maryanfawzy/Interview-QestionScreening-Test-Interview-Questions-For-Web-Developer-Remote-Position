                <p class="answer" data-text="
                JavaScript is playing a very major role in web development such as:

                1. For the user side: It allows the user to interact with the web page.

                2. Handling Events: JS allows the user to interact with web pages like clicking buttons, filling form inputs, or submitting forms.

                3. JS Libraries: With JS frontend libraries like React.js and Vue.js, it makes it very easy to build a very good web application with a very good user interface.

                4. It can work with any browser.

                5. We can work with the backend using only one language: JS, because of Node.js technology.

                6. Asynchronous Operation: We can fetch any API data from servers very easily and fast.

                7. DOM Manipulation: It allows modifications to update the content, style, and so on without requiring a full-page reload.

                <p class="answer" data-text="
                ‚Ä¢ In web development, web hosting refers to the process of storing and serving website files, making the website accessible on the internet.

                ‚Ä¢ There are various ways to deploy a site, such as using a domain name, server, or storage.

                ‚Ä¢ Examples: Vercel, Netlify, and GitHub.

                <p class="answer" data-text="
                ‚Ä¢ API stands for Application Programming Interface. 

                ‚Ä¢ It allows a website to fetch and send data from a database or another website."></p>

                <h3>7. What is HTML, and why is it important in web development?</h3>
                <p class="answer" data-text="
                ‚Ä¢ HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

                ‚Ä¢ It is essential for web development as it is used to create web pages and define their structure. HTML includes various elements and tags such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, and more.

                Why is it important?

                1.	It works with all web browsers worldwide.

                2.	It is the foundation of web applications. 

                3.	It works alongside CSS and JavaScript: 

                ‚Ä¢	HTML: Defines the content.
                ‚Ä¢	CSS: Provides the styling.
                ‚Ä¢	JavaScript: Adds functionality.

                4. Semantic Meaning: Allows structuring elements properly, such as using header, footer, and section.

                <h3>8.  What is CSS, and how does it contribute to web development?</h3>
                <p class="answer" data-text="
                CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, it is a styling language responsible for the style and decoration of web applications. For example, we can control colors, fonts, animations, and responsive layouts.

                How does it contribute?
                
                ‚Ä¢ Responsive Design: CSS media queries allow web pages to adapt to different screen sizes.

                ‚Ä¢ Manages styling of the web page.

                ‚Ä¢ Animations: CSS allows us to add cool animation effects to websites.

                ‚Ä¢ We can use external stylesheets to ensure consistency."></p>

                <h3>9. What is AJAX, and how does it work?</h3>
                <p class="answer" data-text="
                AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which is a technique used to send and receive data from the server without reloading the entire web page, making web applications interactive, faster, and dynamic.

                How does it work?
                
                ‚Ä¢ User Action: A user performs an action, such as clicking a button.

                ‚Ä¢ Send the Request: Once clicked, JS uses the XMLHttpRequest object or Fetch API to send an asynchronous request to the server.

                ‚Ä¢ Processing: The server retrieves the requested data.

                ‚Ä¢ Response: The server responds with JSON, XML, or HTML data.

                ‚Ä¢ The web page updates dynamically: JS processes the response and updates the webpage without reloading."></p>

                </h3>
                <p class="answer" data-text="
                ‚Ä¢ Inline: It starts on the same line and cannot have width and height set, like 'span'. It only takes up as much space as its content.

                ‚Ä¢ Block: It starts on a new line by default and takes up the entire width of the parent container, like 'p'."></p>

                <h3>11. What is a callback function in JavaScript?</h3>
                <p class="answer" data-text="
                ‚Ä¢ A callback is usually used for asynchronous operations, such as handling API requests or event listeners.

                ‚Ä¢  It is usually a function that is passed as an argument to another function to execute later after the completion of an operation."></p>

                <h3>12. Explain the difference between session storage and local storage?</h3>
                <p class="answer" data-text="
                ‚Ä¢ Both are part of the Web Storage API and are used to store data in the user's browser.

                - Local Storage:
                
               1.  Permanently stores the data until it is removed by the user or JS.
               2.  Data is stored even after reloading or closing and reopening the browser.
               3. Stores up to 5 MB of data and must be in the same domain.

                - Session Storage:
                
               1. Stores data temporarily for a single browser session.
               2. Data is deleted once the browser is closed.
               3. Only accessible within the same tab."></p>

                <p class="answer" data-text="
                DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML document.
                ‚Ä¢ It allows JS to dynamically interact with and manipulate web pages.
                
                What does it do?
                
                ‚Ä¢ Access Elements: Select HTML elements using JS.

                ‚Ä¢ Modify Content: Change text, images, or HTML dynamically.

                ‚Ä¢ Handle Events: Respond to user actions.

                ‚Ä¢ Changing Styles: Apply CSS styles dynamically.

                ‚Ä¢ Create or Remove Elements: Add or remove elements dynamically."></p>

                <p class="answer" data-text="
                A responsive website adjusts itself automatically to fit different screen sizes.

                Why is it essential?
                
                ‚Ä¢ Better User Experience: Ensures a smooth experience on all devices.

                ‚Ä¢ Cheaper: A single website that works on all devices eliminates the need for multiple versions.

                ‚Ä¢ Faster Loading: Optimized performance improves speed.

                ‚Ä¢ Very good for mobile devices: Since most users access websites through their phones, responsiveness ensures a smooth experience on smartphones."></p>

                An HTML tag is a piece of code enclosed in angle brackets < >.
                    We use it to create elements.

                Cache is a storage mechanism that saves website data locally on a user‚Äôs device to improve loading speed and performance.

                How it works:

                1.	When a user visits a website, the browser stores some data in the cache.

                2.	On future visits, the browser loads cached files instead of downloading them again.

                3.	If the website updates, the cache may be cleared to fetch the latest version.
