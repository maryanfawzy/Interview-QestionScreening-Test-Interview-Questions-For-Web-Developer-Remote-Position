                6- Asynchronous Operation: We can fetch any API data from servers very easily and fast.
                7- DOM Manipulation: It allows modifications to update the content, style, and so on without requiring a full-page reload.

                How does it work?
                
                User Action: A user performs an action, such as clicking a button.
                Send the Request: Once clicked, JS uses the XMLHttpRequest object or Fetch API to send an asynchronous request to the server.

                Response: The server responds with JSON, XML, or HTML data.
                The web page updates dynamically: JS processes the response and updates the webpage without reloading."></p>

                Data is stored even after reloading or closing and reopening the browser.
                Stores up to 5 MB of data and must be in the same domain.
                Session Storage:
                
                Stores data temporarily for a single browser session.
                Data is deleted once the browser is closed.
